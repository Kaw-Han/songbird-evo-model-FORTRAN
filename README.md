# songbird-evo-model-FORTRAN
Modeling evolution in a genetically simple population of songbirds. Using Fortran. OOP

The article discusses the data in light of Allen et. al (2022). In the article produced by Allen and co-authors, they use predator-sounds in songbird habitats to examine the effects of fear-induced changes in the population. The aim of the model is to illuminate the changes in decision-making on the individual level, or the lack there of, and the subsequent consequences on a population level. 


The main code is in first_model.f90, use makefile: type "make" in terminal to run model.
