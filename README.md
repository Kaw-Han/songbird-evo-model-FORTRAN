# songbird-evo-model-FORTRAN
Modelling evolution in a genetically simple population of songbirds. Using Fortran. OOP

The code's experimental data was examined and explained in the following article: https://bikuben.w.uib.no/the-proximate-mechanisms-behind-fear-an-ibm-approach-to-understanding-behavioral-changes-in-songbirds-and-the-subsequent-evolutionary-trajectory-2/.
The article discusses the data in light of Allen et. al (2022). In the article produced by Allen and co-authors, they use predator-sounds in songbird habitats to examine the effects. In comparing our data with Allen and co-authors', similair findings can be shown in population growth for the first five or so generations. Where Allen et al stops their experiment, we continue the model and show evolution based on fear-response in songbirds.
